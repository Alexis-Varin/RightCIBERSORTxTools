Description: This package provides a set of tools to generate CIBERSORTx input files from RNA-seq data,
    namely a Reference Matrix (a Seurat object's RNA counts in a tab delimited txt file with cell identity as column name)
    and a Mixture File (a tab delimited txt file with each column containing CPM of a bulk RNA-seq or microarray experiment)
    all in a single function.
