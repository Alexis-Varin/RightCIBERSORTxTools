# RightCIBERSORTxTools

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This package provides a set of tools to generate CIBERSORTx input files from RNA-seq data, namely a Reference Matrix (a Seurat object's RNA counts in a tab delimited txt file with cell identity as column name) and a Mixture File (a tab delimited txt file with each column containing CPM of a bulk RNA-seq or microarray experiment) all in a single function.

## Installation

```         
devtools::install_github("Alexis-Varin/RightCIBERSORTxTools")
```

## Good Practice for CIBERSORTx use

-   Building the Reference Matrix takes a lot of time, sometimes up to 30 minutes depending on the size of your Seurat object. I recommend to save your environment before running the function.

-   Your storage capacity on the CIBERSORTx web portal has a limit of 1 GB (please note that not just uploaded files take disk space but also job results). By experience, if your Seurat object has more than 25,000 cells by 20,000 features (or any combination that would produce a matrix length over 500,000,000) your Reference Matrix will be bigger than 1 GB. This is the reason for the various subset and downsample arguments the function has to offer. You can use them to reduce the size of your Seurat object. I also included a failsafe option to stop the function if, before starting to extract the RNA counts, it detects that the Reference Matrix will be over a spÃªcified size limit. This prevents you from waiting a significant amount of time for nothing.

-   While you can always downsample right before building the Reference Matrix with the provided parameters of the Reference Matrix Builder, I very strongly recommend to do it on your Seurat object right after QC and before any downstream analysis (so before normalization, integration, UMAP and FindMarkers) as downsampling after will significantly alter your analysis, especially your differentially expressed genes. I therefore provide a sizing tool to estimate the size of the Reference Matrix that would be built from your Seurat object and suggest a number of cells to downsample from it. You can then use the suggested number of cells to downsample your Seurat object before any downstream analysis or even let the function do it for you.

## Reference_Matrix_Sizer

### Description

This function calculates the size of a Reference Matrix which would be built from a Seurat object and suggests a number of cells to downsample from the object or performs that downsample to be under a specified size limit.

### Dependencies

-   Seurat
-   SeuratObject

### Usage

```         
Reference_Matrix_Sizer(
  seurat_object,
  max.matrix.size = 900,
  downsample = FALSE
)
```

| **seurat_object**   | A Seurat object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **max.matrix.size** | Numeric. The maximum size of the Reference Matrix file written to disk in MB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **downsample**      | Logical. If TRUE, downsample the Seurat object so that the Reference Matrix file written to disk would be just under the max.matrix.size limit (empirical). Please report an issue if you see a significant difference between the .txt or .tsv file written to disk and max.matrix.size (for example max.matrix.size is set to 200 MB but the .txt file is 400 MB or 100 MB). |

### Output

The Seurat object, an estimation of the Reference Matrix size in MB and a suggestion of the number of cells to downsample. If downsample = TRUE, the Seurat object will instead be downsampled to the suggested number of cells.

### Example

```         
Reference_Matrix_Sizer(
  seurat_object = pbmc1k,
  max.matrix.size = 20,
  downsample = FALSE
)
```
